  <h2>Automatic Installation (Recommended)</h2>
  <p>
    NgVerse is not an installable library in the traditional sense; there's no
    need to run npm install ngverse. Instead, NgVerse provides a convenient
    schematic to handle the setup for you, making the process of copying and
    integrating components into your project seamless and automatic. To get
    started, run the following command:
  </p>
  <doc-source-code language="bash" code="ng add ngverse"></doc-source-code>
  <h3>What Does This Do?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Adds NgVerse schematics dependency:</strong> This will manage the
      integration of components into your project without the need to manually
      copy or paste them.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Add Angular/cdk:</strong> Provides utility features like keyboard
      navigation and floating panel support (e.g., dialogs), which are essential
      for certain NgVerse components.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Provide Animations config:</strong>
      Adds animation configurations to the root of your project for seamless
      functionality of components like the accordion, which relies on smooth
      open/close animations.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Add globals.scss style file:</strong>
      globals.scss file will be added in your project and imported into your
      styles.scss. For more details, refer to the Theming Guide.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Ready to Use</h3>
  <p>
    Once the installation is complete, you can generate a component with the
    following command:
  </p>
  <doc-source-code
    language="bash"
    code="ng generate ngverse:component button"
  ></doc-source-code>
  <p>
    By default, this will create the button component inside the core/components
    folder of your project. For more information on using schematics, see the
    Schematics Usage Guide.
  </p>
