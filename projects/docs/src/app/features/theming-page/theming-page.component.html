<!-- <h1>Theming</h1>
<p>
  NGVerse Components come with a predefined look and feel, ensuring visual
  consistency across all components. However, the library is not themed
  globally—there’s no theme.scss to import, no global CSS variables to manage,
  and no reliance on external theming files. This approach is intentional and
  designed with the following principles in mind:
</p>
<h2>Encapsulation Over Abstraction</h2>
<p>
  Each component is fully encapsulated, with all styles scoped directly to the
  component itself. This design ensures that when you integrate a component into
  your project, the behavior and styles are localized, making it easy to
  identify and modify them. There’s no need to sift through global files or
  decipher documentation to override a specific style.
</p>
<h2>Flexibility Over Prescriptive Theming</h2>
<p>
  NGVerse is designed to be a general-purpose component library, intended to
  adapt to your specific design requirements rather than enforcing a universal
  design system like Material Design. While the components share a cohesive
  default styling for a polished look, they are meant to serve as a foundation
  that you can easily customize to match your designer’s specifications.
</p>
<h2>Coherent and Polished Default Styling</h2>
<p>
  Even without a general theming system, all <doc-project-name></doc-project-name> components are thoughtfully
  styled to ensure they are visually cohesive and blend seamlessly together.
  This makes it easy to use the library out of the box, with a consistent design
  across components.
</p>
<h2>Practicality in Customization</h2>
<p>
  The styling approach allows you to quickly get started without needing
  detailed design files. For example, if you want to change the primary color of
  a button or an active tab, you can directly edit the button.component.scss and
  tab.component.scss files. While this may involve duplicating effort in some
  cases, it eliminates the complexity of navigating theming systems or
  overriding global variables.
</p>
<h2>Support for Custom Variables</h2>
<p>
  If you have a well-defined design system, you can easily introduce CSS
  variables or SCSS variables within your project. These can then be referenced
  in the individual component style files for a more streamlined approach to
  theming.
</p>
<p>
  This theming approach strikes a balance between simplicity and flexibility,
  ensuring that developers can quickly adapt NGVerse components to their needs
  while maintaining full control over the design.
