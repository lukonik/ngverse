    NgVerse components do not rely on a global theme file to style all
    components. Instead, each component's styles are self-contained within its
    own SCSS file. To update the style of a specific component, simply edit its
    corresponding SCSS file directly.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, there is a small global.scss file included, which contains
    predefined variables, such as primary-color, that components can use. The
    purpose of this file is to ensure consistent and visually appealing styles
    across components, particularly if you do not have a custom design in place.
    That said, you are free to ignore this file entirely or remove the use of
    these global variables within individual componentsâ€”it's entirely up to you.

    For example, if you want to change the style of the Button component, avoid
    overriding classes in the global styles.scss file. Instead, make your
    changes directly in the button.scss file.
