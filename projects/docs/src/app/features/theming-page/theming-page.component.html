    <doc-project-name [code]="true"></doc-project-name> relies on
    <code>Tailwind CSS</code>
    as its styling framework, meaning all components are styled using Tailwind
    utility classes and CSS variables. With <code>Tailwind CSS v4</code>, the
    <doc-project-name [code]="true"></doc-project-name> library has fully
    transitioned to native CSS, moving away from preprocessors like SASS or
    LESS. As a result, all
    <doc-project-name [code]="true"></doc-project-name> components are built
    using pure CSS instead of SASS. However, thanks to Tailwind CSS, features
    such as nesting and other enhancements previously available in preprocessors
    are now natively supported
  </p>
  <p>
    <doc-project-name [code]="true"></doc-project-name> comes with a predefined
    Tailwind CSS theme configuration to maintain a consistent design across all
    components. Most of the theme settings are color variables used throughout
    the components. This setup ensures that if you want to change the primary
    color, you can do so in a single place, and it will automatically apply to
    all components.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, by default, the primary color is:
    <code>--color-blue-500 </code> If you want to change it to amber, simply
    update it to: <code>--color-amber-500</code>
    This makes customization easy and ensures design consistency across your
    project.

  <h3>CSS Variables</h3>
  <p>CSS Variables follow the following pattern:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>--color-name</code>: Background color</li>
    <li><code>--color-name-foreground</code>: Text color</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Customizing Component Styles</h3>
  <p>
    While <doc-project-name [code]="true"></doc-project-name> provides a default
    styling system, you are not restricted to using it as-is. You have full
    flexibility to customize component styles inside their respective styling
    files based on your project’s needs. How you choose to style the components
    is entirely up to you—whether by extending Tailwind classes, adding custom
    styles, or overriding existing ones.
    <doc-project-name [code]="true"></doc-project-name> is designed to be
    adaptable, allowing you to create a unique design while maintaining
    consistency.
