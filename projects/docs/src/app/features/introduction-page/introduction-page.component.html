    The world has changed since the AI revolution—and it continues to change
    rapidly. In the past, we relied on third-party libraries to integrate
    prebuilt components into our apps. Today, we often ask AI to generate these
    components on demand. While this can be powerful, it comes with a cost:
    AI-generated code is often unpredictable, inconsistent, and prone to subtle
    bugs.
  </p>
  <p>That’s exactly what ngverse/ui aims to solve.</p>
  <p>
    <doc-project-name [code]="true"></doc-project-name> is a powerful Angular
    library packed with high-quality, production-ready components, directives,
    pipes animations—just to name a few. robust, flexible, and of course easy to
    customize.
  </p>
  <p>
    Using <doc-project-name [code]="true"></doc-project-name> feels just like
    copying code from an AI tool into your app—but with a big difference:
    everything here is tested, stable, and feature-rich.
  </p>
  <div class="italic">
    Even though the project name is <doc-project-name></doc-project-name>. It
    not only includes <span class="font-bold">UI</span> components, but plenty
    of other Angular features.
  </div>
  <h2>How it works</h2>
  <p>
    <doc-project-name [code]="true"></doc-project-name> includes Angular
    schematics that automatically add the source code of components, directives,
    and other Angular features directly into your app.
  </p>
  <p>For example, if you want to add a select component, just run:</p>
  <pre><code>ng g &#64;ngverse/ui:ui select</code></pre>
  <p>
    This will generate the complete, fully functional source code for the select
    component—right inside your project.
  </p>
  <h2>Dependencies</h2>
  <p>
    <doc-project-name [code]="true"></doc-project-name> features depend on
    low-level libraries—only when it makes the code more readable, stable, and
    avoids overly complex or “crypto-like” logic in your app. However source
    code is yours, you can update it however you want.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each module will contain its own dependencies list and installation
    instructions.
  </p>

  <h2>Have a Generic Feature Idea?</h2>
  <p>
    As developers, we often find ourselves building the same features across
    different projects and companies. If you have a feature in mind that you
    think is generic and reusable, we'd love to hear about it! You’re welcome to
