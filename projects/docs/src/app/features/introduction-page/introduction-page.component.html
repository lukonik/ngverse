    NgVerse is a collection of feature-rich Angular components, directives,
    pipes, and more. It has one key difference from other UI libraries: you
    don’t install it as a dependency but instead copy/paste the components
    directly into your project.
  </p>
  <h2>What Does Copy/Paste Mean?</h2>
  <p>
    Typically, when you need to use a UI library, you install it via a package
    manager like npm. For example:
  </p>
  <pre> <code>npm install angular-some-ui-library</code> </pre>
  <p>
    After installation, you configure it and import the required components from
    the library. NgVerse is different. You don’t install the library itself.
    Instead, you get premade, complete Angular components that you copy/paste
    into your project. However, this doesn’t mean you have to copy/paste
    manually; we provide schematics that handle the setup for components
    seamlessly.

  <h2>Why?</h2>
  <p>
    I’ve been using Angular since its release and have extensively worked with
    various UI libraries, including Angular Material. A common issue I’ve
    encountered is that customization is often a difficult and not practical.
    You either have to use the components as they are or not use them at all.
    While some libraries offer more customization freedom, they still impose
    restrictions, making it difficult to create generic components. For
    instance, if your design requires all select components to have a clear
    icon, you would either need to manually add this functionality to each
    select component or wrap the library’s select component in your own custom
    implementation—neither of which is ideal. What you actually need is a solid
    starting point. When designing a website, you typically require components
    like inputs, buttons, dropdowns, accordions, and tabs with various
    customizations. All of these components should follow a consistent guideline
    and be fully featured. For example, when you add a select component to your
    project, it should include essential features like floating options and
    keyboard navigation. This is exactly what NgVerse is designed to provide.
    When you add a select component from NgVerse, you get a complete,
    fully-featured component that adheres to general guidelines. Plus, the
    source code is part of your project, allowing you to customize it however
    you want. If you want to change the style or functionality of a select
    component, you don’t need to read extensive documentation or examine complex
    markup to update styles. Instead, you can directly edit the source code in
    your project. In addition to that, all the components are beautifully styled
    and coherent with one another. So, if you don’t have a design, you can start
    using them right away.
