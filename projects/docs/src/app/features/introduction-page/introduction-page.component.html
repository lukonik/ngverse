    The world has changed since the AI revolution—and it continues to change
    rapidly. In the past, we relied on third-party libraries to integrate
    prebuilt components into our apps. Today, we often ask AI to generate these
    components on demand. While this can be powerful, it comes with a cost:
    AI-generated code is often unpredictable, inconsistent, and prone to subtle
    bugs.
  </p>
  <p>That’s exactly what ngverse/ui aims to solve.</p>
  <p>
    <doc-project-name [code]="true"></doc-project-name> is a powerful Angular
    library packed with high-quality, production-ready components, directives,
    pipes animations—just to name a few. It’s built on top of
    <a href="https://material.angular.io/cdk/categories" target="_blank"
      >&#64;angular/cdk</a
    >
    and
    <a href="https://material.angular.io/cdk/categories" target="_blank"
      >Tailwind CSS</a
    >
    to ensure everything is robust, flexible, and easy to customize.
  </p>
  <p>
    Using <doc-project-name [code]="true"></doc-project-name> feels just like
    copying code from an AI tool into your app—but with a big difference:
    everything here is tested, stable, and feature-rich.
  </p>
  <h2>How it works</h2>
  <p>
    <doc-project-name [code]="true"></doc-project-name> includes Angular
    schematics that automatically add the source code of components, directives,
    and other UI features directly into your app.
  </p>
  <p>For example, if you want to add a select component, just run:</p>
  <pre><code>ng g &#64;ngverse/ui:ui select</code></pre>
  <p>
    This will generate the complete, fully functional source code for the select
    component—right inside your project.
  </p>
  <p>
    You get complete control over the code: it’s customizable, tested, and ready
    to use—as if you had written it yourself, but without the hassle.
  </p>
  <h2>Dependencies</h2>
  <p>
    The core dependencies behind
    <doc-project-name [code]="true"></doc-project-name> are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>&#64;angular/cdk</li>
    <li>Tailwind CSS</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These two libraries form the backbone of most features in
    <doc-project-name [code]="true"></doc-project-name>
  </p>
  <p>
    However, in some edge cases, we rely on a few lightweight, low-level
    libraries—only when it makes the code more readable, stable, and avoids
    overly complex or “crypto-like” logic in your app.
  </p>
  <p>For example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The <code>kebabCase</code> pipe uses the popular
      <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/change-case">change-case</a>
      library to keep the implementation simple and reliable.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <div
    class="rounded border-l-4 border-yellow-400 bg-yellow-50 p-4 text-yellow-800"
  >
    You only need to install The Optional dependencies when a specific feature
    requires them.
  </div>
  <h2>Have a Generic Feature Idea?</h2>
  <p>
    As developers, we often find ourselves building the same features across
    different projects and companies. If you have a feature in mind that you
    think is generic and reusable, we'd love to hear about it! You’re welcome to
    submit a feature request
