    <code><doc-project-name></doc-project-name></code> is a collection of
    feature-rich Angular components. It has one key difference from other UI
    libraries: <br />
    <strong>you donâ€™t install it as a dependency</strong>. Instead, you add the
    source code of the components directly into your project.
  </p>

  <h2>What does that mean?</h2>

  <p>
    Typically, when you use a UI library, you install the library as a
    dependency and then import components from it.<br />
    <doc-project-name [code]="true"></doc-project-name> is different. You
    install the schematics and selectively add the components you need. The
    component's source code is injected into your project, making it
    <strong>fully customizable</strong>. You can explore, update, or leave it as
    is.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, if you were using a traditional Angular UI library, the steps
    would look like this:
  </p>
  <doc-source-code
    language="bash"
    code="npm install angular-ui-library"
  ></doc-source-code>

  <p>And to use a button component:</p>
  <doc-source-code
    language="bash"
    code="import { ButtonComponent } from 'angular-ui-library'"
  ></doc-source-code>

  <p>
    In the case of <code><doc-project-name></doc-project-name></code>, the
    process is different, your run:
  </p>

  <doc-source-code
    language="bash"
    code="ng g @ngverse/ui:add button"
  ></doc-source-code>

  <p>
    This command adds the full source code for the button component to your
    project. It behaves just as if you had created it yourself.
  </p>

  <h2>Key Features</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Tailwind:</strong> We use Tailwind CSS as a CSS framework</li>
    <li>
      <strong>Zoneless:</strong> We don't rely on <code>zone.js</code>. All
      components are zoneless, meaning they will work regardless of whether your
      app includes <code>zone.js</code> or not.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Fully Customizable:</strong> The complete source code is yours, so
      it is 100% customizable.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Accessibility:</strong> We prioritize accessibility, including
      features like keyboard navigation and focus management. Generated
      components have these behaviors by default.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Modular Approach:</strong> You only add what you need. No
      unnecessary components or features are bundled into your project.
    </li>
  </ul>
